This repository demonstrates a common error in Dockerfiles: using an unstable base image. The original Dockerfile uses `ubuntu:latest`, which pulls the newest version of Ubuntu at build time.  This is problematic as the latest version may contain breaking changes that unexpectedly affect the application inside the container. The solution uses a specific Ubuntu LTS version to ensure reproducibility and stability across builds.
